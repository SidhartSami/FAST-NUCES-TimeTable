# FAST NUCES TIMETABLE

A Streamlit-based web application designed to help FAST NUCES Islamabad students quickly extract and view their class schedules. Instead of repeatedly checking a Google Sheet, users can simply select their courses and instantly see only their classes—no need to scroll through the entire university timetable.

## Live Demo

Access the live website at: [nucestimetable.streamlit.app](https://nucestimetable.streamlit.app)

## Features

- **Google Sheets Integration:**  
  Automatically downloads and parses class schedules from a pre-defined set of Google Sheets URLs for each day.

- **My Class Adder:**  
  Select your courses from the options available in the sheets, and the application will display only your chosen classes instead of the entire university timetable.

- **Dynamic Free Room Finder:**  
  Identifies and displays free classrooms for specific time slots by checking occupied rooms against available ones.

- **Dark Mode & White Mode:**  
  Toggle between dark mode and white mode for an enhanced user experience based on your lighting conditions or personal preference.

- **Flexible Filtering:**  
  Allows users to search within their saved class lists or filter by department.
